# Automobile-Linear-Optimization
Created and conducted linear optimization models with Python

Problem Statement
Linear programming is a set of mathematical techniques used to solve systems of linear equations and inequalities while maximizing or minimizing some linear function for a desired result. Over the years, linear programming has become important in fields such as scientific computing, economics, and other management systems. Because of the increase in demand for calculations to be done in this manner, reliance on powerful tools such as Python programming is becoming a necessity when optimizing linear programming problems.

For the purpose of this project, the following problem was assigned:
“An Auto company must meet the following demands for cars during the next 4 months: month 1 - 4,000; month 2 - 2,000; month 3 - 5,000; month 4 - 1,000. At the beginning of month 1, there are 300 autos in stock, and the company has the capacity to produce at most 3,000 cars per month. At the beginning of each month, the company can change production capacity by one car. It costs $100 to increase monthly production capacity. It costs $50 per month to maintain one car of production (even if it is unused during the current month). The variable cost of producing a car is $3,000. A holding cost of $150 per car is assessed against each month’s ending inventory. It is required that at the end of month 4, plant capacity must be at least 4,000 cars. Formulate an LP to minimize the total cost incurred during the next four months.”

Running the "automobiles.py" file will output the optimized constraints for this particular automobiles company.
